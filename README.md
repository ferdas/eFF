# eFF - electronic FillableForm 

eFF is a simple library to build a fillable and printable form

## How it works
This simple library allows you to design your fillable forms in pure HTML and have them printed out in PDF (non automatic process at the moment) in a easy and clean way.
Plus, this library allows you to pass some json data to the page and automagically fill the form with the given information.
Less fillable PDF and more HTML5 compliant forms!

## How to use it
Just include the magic lines into the header of the form page you want to make fillable and printable
~~~~
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="res/eff/eff.css" />
<script src="res/eff/eff.js"></script>
~~~~
and stick to the example page (soon online) as to class naming!

### TODOs
